- Remember ".iol" files
    - are they still used?
- better block (use line somehow)
    - better line (store rest of line in lemex instead of as tokens)


For Report:
- Why not the Jolie parser
    - jolie parser "optimises" (changes) code during execution causing changes in code when compared with original
        - loss of data and changes to original
        - Give examples using jolie printer (git)
    - (Write from perspective of what I did, not what I didn't do)
- cast all end line symbols to \n
- pre and post lexeme for printing
