- Remember ".iol" files
  - are they still used?
- Error reporting?

- Other manual
  - test extraction on
    - smaller and larger changes commited
    - better and worse descriptions

For Report:
- Why not the Jolie parser
  - jolie parser "optimises" (changes) code during execution causing changes in code when compared with original
    - loss of data and changes to original
    - Give examples using jolie printer (git)
  - (Write from perspective of what I did, not what I didn't do)
- cast all end line symbols to \n
- pre and post lexeme for printing
